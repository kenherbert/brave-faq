The site can be found at [bravefaq.com](http://bravefaq.com).



**Please note there is no code or data held here, this repo is purely an issue tracker for site content.**


## How to contribute

### Reporting problems

If you see a problem with any data on the site please [create a new issue](https://github.com/thefallofbecause/brave-faq/issues). Make sure you link the page in question and describe exactly what is wrong and how it could be improved.

If the problem is specifically regarding information that is outdated please add the "outdated content" label so it receives the extra visibility it requires.


### Submitting new content

If you have a new entry you would like to submit to the site please [create a new issue](https://github.com/thefallofbecause/brave-faq/issues) with the "new content" label. Include the text plus any screenshots you think support the content in the issue.

Submitted screenshots should not include any private information, and should not include any kind of advertisement. A screenshot that includes any software or website that is not specifically pertinent to the entry will not be posted.

Please understand that for the purpose of site consistency I may rewrite some content, and may add, edit, or leave out screenshots as I see fit.

#### Restrictions on content
Please do not submit anything that would actively go against Brave's terms of service, would break the law, or is otherwise immoral or potentially harmful towards anyone. These submissions will be removed.

#### Attribution
If you include your Brave-verified Reddit, Twitter, or Github account with the submission I will link you in the article so grateful users can find a place to tip you. Websites, YouTube, Vimeo, or Twitch will not be included because I'm not here to advertise you or give you external links.
